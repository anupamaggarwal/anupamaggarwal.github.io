<p>Agent smith</p>

<p>Smith began as an Agent, programmed by Anupam to keep order within the system by terminating human simulacra which would bring instability to the simulated workflow stream of the application, as well as any rogue programs like cron that no longer serve a purpose to software collective
To this end, Smith possesses the ability to take control over the simulated body of any functions wired into the workflow</p>
